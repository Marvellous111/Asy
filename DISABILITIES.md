This readme provides insights on the disabilities feature of tambo making the template supercharged

The disabilities template will feature a bunch of ui screens to test it out

The "agent" will be at the top of the screen floating in order to access it easily

In order to enable the disability agent the developer can simply enable it via a line of code or something similar

The first will contain a dashboard, with components or hardcorded elements to showcase

The second will be a blog post with pictures if necessary as well just so we can work it out.

The agent will float possibly at the top right of the screen or bottom right

The text agent will flash open when the user clicks on it

The voice agent will enlarge similar to the text agent - done

They will both stay on the same part side by side on the top or bottom right.

they will not go to the center of the screen so that it wont disrupt any thing important.

The agent will be a component that will wrap the entire page.
